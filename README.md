# chess-board

This is the start of making a light up chess board

I got inspired from this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/11chyrq/made_some_progress_on_the_chessboard_this_week/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

big help as well to the Elctromaker discord for helping me

TODO:

    add LEDs
    more power/ground rails for the leds???
